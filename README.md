# fraud-detection
Basic ML project for Fraud detection 

The dataset used in this project is confidential and cannot be shared publicly. However, it contains information about various transactions including transaction amount, transaction type, time of transaction, etc. The dataset has been preprocessed to ensure anonymity and confidentiality of the users involved. The machine learning model used for this project is a binary classifier, trained using logistic regression, a supervised learning algorithm. Logistic regression is chosen for its simplicity and interpretability, making it a suitable choice for this task.
The model performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix provides insights into the model's ability to correctly classify instances as fraudulent or not fraudulent. From the confusion matrix, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be calculated to assess the model's performance.
