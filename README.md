# fraud-detection
An ML model to predict fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions

The dataset used in this project is confidential and cannot be shared publicly. However, it contains information about various transactions including transaction amount, transaction type, time of transaction, etc. The dataset has been preprocessed to ensure anonymity and confidentiality of the users involved. The machine learning model used for this project are trained using logistic regression, random forest and decision tree, which are supervised learning algorithms. Logistic regression is chosen for its simplicity and interpretability, making it a suitable choice for this task. Followed by random forest model and decision tree model so that the comparison between the performance metrics of the three different algorithms will help us provide insights with better accuracy and choose the best model for our data.
The model performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix provides insights into the model's ability to correctly classify instances as fraudulent or not fraudulent. From the confusion matrix, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be calculated to assess the model's performance. We also used ROC curve and it's respective AUC score for each model.
